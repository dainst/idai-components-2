# iDAI.components 2
 
## Getting started

Clone this repository and run

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start (= npm run server)
```

The last command starts a webserver listening on http://localhost:8083.

## Demo

The demo app is used to display the functionality of the library.
It makes use of the configuration files at

```
demo/config
```

which will get automatically created from their template counterparts
by `npm run build` in case they don't exist.

## Testing


Unit test the library files with

```
$ npm test
```

E2E test the library by running the server, then opening another terminal and running

```
$ npm run e2e
```


## Using the library

SCSS files:

```
src/scss/idai-components-2.scss
```

Module exports, which can be used via systemjs:

```
configuration.ts
core.ts
datastore.ts
documents.ts
idai-field-map.ts
idai-field-model.ts
messages.ts

```

## Publishing via NPM

A npm account (which could be signed up here: https://www.npmjs.com/signup) and 
the user rights on this npm package are required.
To make sure the version number on github is not behind your
local version it is recommended to maintain the following order
of commands when publishing

```
git add . && git commit -m ""         # Commit your local changes
npm login
npm run build
npm version patch -m "New release %s" # which creates another commit
npm publish
git push
```
